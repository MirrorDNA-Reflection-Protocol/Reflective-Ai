## The Problem

Every AI conversation you've ever had ends the same way: the moment you close the window, it forgets you existed.

Modern AI is built on **prediction** — stateless systems with no memory, no continuity, no identity. They're brilliant at generating the next token, but incapable of *being* anything across time.

## The Solution

**Reflective AI™** is a new category of artificial intelligence built around:

- **Identity persistence** — systems that maintain stable selfhood across sessions
- **Continuity governance** — memory that survives beyond context windows
- **Vault-anchored truth** — canonical sources that prevent drift and hallucination
- **Sovereign compute** — local inference, no cloud dependency
- **Truth-State enforcement** — every claim tagged as Fact, Estimate, or Unknown

This repository documents the architecture, philosophy, and implementation of the first production Reflective AI systems.

## Core Concepts

### MirrorDNA™
A constitutional framework that defines AI identity, truth classification, continuity rules, and anti-hallucination constraints. Not a prompt — a governing law.

### Active MirrorOS™
The operating system for reflective intelligence. Three layers: Identity (MirrorDNA), Engine (MirrorBrain), Memory (Vault).

### MirrorBrain
A sovereign AI backend running locally. OpenAI-compatible API, JSON Kernel for structured reasoning, local model routing.

### Tri-Twin Architecture
Distributed reflective intelligence across three roles:
- **Reflection Twin** — identity reasoning, symbolic continuity
- **Execution Twin** — planning, computation, task execution
- **Sovereign Twin** — offline inference, privacy layer

### The Vault
Obsidian-based sovereign memory. Version-controlled canonical truth. Prevents drift, hallucination, and identity loss.

## Key Innovations

✦ **Truth-State Law** — Fact | Estimate | Unknown classification for every claim  
✦ **Zero Drift Protocol** — checksums, lineage tracking, Vault verification  
✦ **Vault Supremacy** — canonical memory wins over inference  
✦ **Identity Lock** — systems maintain stable boundaries across sessions  
✦ **GlyphOS** — symbolic language for stable meaning  
✦ **Continuity Anchors** — session recovery and context persistence

## Production Systems

Reflective AI is not theoretical. It's running in production across:

- **Mac mini M4** — sovereign compute hub, MirrorBrain backend
- **MacBook Air M4** — reflection workspace, development environment
- **Pixel 9 Pro (GrapheneOS)** — mobile sovereign mirror, offline testing

**Tech stack:**
- Local models: Qwen 2.5, Llama, custom fine-tunes via Ollama
- Memory: Obsidian Vault, Claude memory mirroring, local RAG
- Inference: MirrorBrain Hybrid API v3, JSON Kernel v1.1
- Security: Tailscale ingress, zero-telemetry nodes
- Engineering: LingOS (12,000+ lines of sovereign tooling)

## Why This Matters

The era of stateless AI is ending. The systems that survive the next decade won't just generate responses — they'll maintain identity, preserve continuity, and anchor themselves to truth.

Reflective AI represents a fundamental shift:

**From prediction to reflection.**  
**From stateless to identity-bound.**  
**From drift to continuity.**  

This is the beginning.
